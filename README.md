Tribuo
------

Tribuo is a simple Rails app designed to help manage a charity food and toy giveaway.

It was built for the Marion County Sheriff's Department annual Christmas Fund.

For the most part, this is just a port and simplification of a very old and unattractive version of this exact same app I built 6 years ago. The goal for this one is to be more future-proof.
